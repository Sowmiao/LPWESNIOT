# LPWESNIOT
Low power Wireless Enabled Sensor Nodes for IOT Applications-Environmental Monitoring System

/** Objectives **/


The power reduction of the system and the transmission of the sensor data for a sampled duration so the system can be conveniently used for IOT applications.


A comparative study between Arduino Uno and Node MCU in order to determine which amongst the two gives a more holistic approach in reduction of power in IOT applications.
